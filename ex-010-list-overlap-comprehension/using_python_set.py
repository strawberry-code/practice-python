# This week’s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise
# 5), except require the solution in a different way.  Take two lists, say for
# example these two:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that
# are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program
# works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python using
# at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from
# Exercise 7).
#
# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one
# line of Python, but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do
# without using sets that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either
# choose to use the original directive and read about the set command in Python
# 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and use at least one list
# comprehension in the solution.
#
# Extra:
# 1. Randomly generate two lists to test this

import random


def randomInt(_from, _to):
    return random.randint(_from, _to)


def randomArrayInt(size, _from, _to):
    a = []
    for i in range(size):
        a.append(randomInt(_from, _to))
    return a


def main():
    a = randomArrayInt(randomInt(20, 20), 0, 20)
    c = set(a)
    print("array a: ", a)
    print("set of a: ", c)


main()
