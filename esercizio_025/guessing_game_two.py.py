# In a previous exercise, we’ve written a program that “knows” a number and asks
# a user to guess it.
#
# This time, we’re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in
# your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and
# you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.
#
# At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it
# took to get your number.
#
# As the writer of this program, you will have to choose how your program will
# strategically guess. A naive strategy can be to simply start the guessing at
# 1, and keep going (2, 3, 4, etc.) until you hit the number. But that’s not an
# optimal guessing strategy. An alternate strategy might be to guess 50 (right
# in the middle of the range), and then increase / decrease by 1 as needed.
# After you’ve written the program, try to find the optimal strategy! (We’ll
# talk about what is the optimal one next # week with the solution.)
